# Sunhacks 2019 "zero to hero" workshop series

A head-first introduction to web development

## Overview

# See the branch "prep/in-memory-messageboard" for the message board

This series will be broken into two workshops:

1. A web application that takes input from users and shows it to other users
2. Add user accounts and authentication to the application created in workshop 1

We're going to be building a message board, sort of like twitter but without the concept of "followers".

## How to use this repo

This is going to be a live coding session, so I won't actually be displaying the slides.

the code we write together will eventually be uploaded to branches listed as `live/...`

The slides will live in the `slides` folder - they're detailed enough to follow as a standalone tutorial. Some of them make references to example branches. Those aren't ready yet unfortunately.
