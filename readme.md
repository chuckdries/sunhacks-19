# Sunhacks 2019 lecture

Welcome! This repository contains my preparation and reference material, as well as the code we wrote together during the class.

Preparation work is done in the branches labeled `prep/...`.

Live lecture code lives in branches labeled `live/...`.

We're going to be building a message board. Sort of like a twitter clone, except with one global timeline and no concept of followers. The first lecture will cover the basics of taking user input and displaying it to other users. The second lecture will go over databases and implement user accounts and a login system.
