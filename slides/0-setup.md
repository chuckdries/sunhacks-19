# 0. Setup your project

1. Install NodeJS (nodejs.org)
2. clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/chuckdries/sunhacks-19`
3. make a folder somewhere that isn't inside my repo you just cloned

```
mkdir message-board-workshop
cd message-board-workshop
```

4. create the npm project and add it to git (you can press enter through all the npm prompts, it doesn't really matter for now)

```
npm init
git init
```
